# **C#**
**Using C# language, you can make developments (coordinate control, angle control, io control, gripper control, etc.) freely through the c# dynamic library provided by our company, and control some of the robots which have been developed by us.**<br>
Available for: **myCobot280, 320 and myPalletizer 260**.<br>

# What is C#?
C# is an object-oriented programming language derived from C and C++ released by Microsoft, and an advanced programming language running on .NET Framework and .NET Core (completely open source and cross-platform). <br>
C# is obviously different from Java. It draws on a feature of Delphi and is directly integrated with COM (Component Object Model); and it is the protagonist of .NET windows network framework of Microsoft.<br>
C# enables C++ programmers to develop programs efficiently, and because native functions written with C/C++ may be called, the original powerful functions of C/C++ will never be affected. Because of this inheritance relationship, C# is very similar to C/C++, and the developers familiar with similar languages are able to quickly turn to C#.<br>

**Applicable equipment:**

- myCobot 280
  - myCobot 280 M5
  - myCobot 280 for Arduino <br>
  
- myCobot 320
  - myCobot 320 M5 <br>


**Preconditions for use：**

- **M5** series version， the bottom **M5Stack-basic** is programmed to miniRobot , select the  **Transponder** function, and the end **ATOM** is programmed to the latest version of atomMain (the factory default has been programmed)
