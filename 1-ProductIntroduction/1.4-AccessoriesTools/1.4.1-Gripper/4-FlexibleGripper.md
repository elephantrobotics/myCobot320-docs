## Use for Gripping Objects

**Introduction**

- Traditional industrial suction cups need to absorb the flat surface of the material. In more and more working conditions, the suction surface is easy to damage the panel or components. The soft-touch gripper pinches the edge to grab the panel easily and without trace or damage, ensuring that the product surface is flawless. , Improve the yield rate.

- The modular design of the soft-touch gripper is light in weight and can be freely arranged and combined according to the size of the panel.

- The clamping force of traditional cylinders is generally large, and the force is difficult to control. The edge of the clamping panel is easy to pinch and warp. The single-finger clamping force of the flexible jaws is precise and controllable, and will not pinch fragile workpieces.

**working principle**

- The flexible gripper is an innovative bionic flexible gripper developed by researchers to imitate the shape of the starfish's arms and legs. The "fingers" of the soft claw are made of flexible polymer silicone material, which can be bent and deformed by inflation. It can adaptively cover the target object like a starfish, and can complete the flexible and non-destructive grasping of special-shaped and fragile objects. Pick.

**Applicable object**

- Objects of any shape within a reasonable size

## How to use

1 Installing: <br>

- Pneumatic Circuit Connection and Pressure Adjustment: Start by adjusting the positive pressure before connecting to the soft mechanical grip (the outlet can temporarily be blocked with a fingertip, ensure the positive pressure is strictly less than 100KPA to avoid potential finger injury).

- For connecting and adjusting the pneumatic circuit: First, set the positive pressure before connecting to a soft mechanical grip. Temporarily block the outlet with a fingertip to prevent air escape, ensuring the positive pressure is strictly below 100KPA to avoid potential injury to the finger.

- **Connect to Air Source**: Attach the air source to port 6 (inlet), ensuring the pressure is above 0.4MPA and flow exceeds 40L/MIN.
- **Connect Soft Mechanical Grip**: Link the soft mechanical grip to port 4 (outlet).
- **Power Up**: Supply power to connection 5.
- **Adjust Positive Pressure**: Use the toggle switch to select positive pressure. Adjust the regulator as per the gauge until desired pressure is reached.
- **Switch to Negative Pressure**: For negative pressure adjustment, pull up the regulator cap, turn to set, then push down to lock.

Special Reminder ⚠️: Regarding pressure maintenance, both positive and negative pressures can be maintained after 0.5 seconds of activation, allowing the mechanical grip to retain its preset pressure. This approach is energy-efficient, especially since maintaining negative pressure continuously consumes more air. Additionally, it prevents the loss of grip on objects in case of unexpected power or air supply cut-offs, ensuring operational reliability.

**Installation and use**

- It needs to be used with an air compressor:
  ![alt text](../../../resources/1-ProductIntroduction/1.4/1.4.1-Gripper/4-FlexibleGripper/空压机.png)

  1. Insert the black plug into the row of plugs;

  2. Insert the matching red hose into the connector on the machine:  
     ![alt text](../../../resources/1-ProductIntroduction/1.4/1.4.1-Gripper/4-FlexibleGripper/空压机安装1.png)
  3. The red button is the on/off switch, pulling it outwards turns it on, pressing it back turns the machine off:
     ![alt text](../../../resources/1-ProductIntroduction/1.4/1.4.1-Gripper/4-FlexibleGripper/空压机按钮.png)

- Clamping jaws mounted:

  1. Connect the other end of the red hose from the air compressor to the connector on the pneumatic controller:
     ![alt text](../../../resources/1-ProductIntroduction/1.4/1.4.1-Gripper/4-FlexibleGripper/结构安装1.png)
  2. Use the blue hose that comes with the flexible gripper to connect the gripper to the pneumatic controller:

     ![alt text](../../../resources/1-ProductIntroduction/1.4/1.4.1-Gripper/4-FlexibleGripper/结构安装3.png)
  3. Attach the flexible gripper to the end of the arm with the matching screws:
     ![alt text](../../../resources/1-ProductIntroduction/1.4/1.4.1-Gripper/4-FlexibleGripper/结构安装4.png)

- Electrical Connections:

  1. Two connection cables are issued, one for power and one for control.

  - At the base of the robot arm, for the power supply, connect the red wire to the 24V connector and the black wire to the GND connector. For the control wires, connect red to OUT1 and black to OUT2:
    ![alt text](../../../resources/1-ProductIntroduction/1.4/1.4.1-Gripper/4-FlexibleGripper/电气连接1.png)
  - Pneumatic controller terminal, power supply wire red connects to pneumatic controller 24V, black connects to pneumatic controller GND, control wire red connects to IN1, black connects to IN2:
    ![alt text](../../../resources/1-ProductIntroduction/1.4/1.4.1-Gripper/4-FlexibleGripper/电气连接2.png)
    > Be careful to connect to the "Positive Voltage" side, if the power supply is successful the display will light up.
    > You can test the connection manually to see if it is working properly by switching the air compressor on and pressing the button on the pneumatic controller, pressing it to the left (positive pressure) will contract the jaws and pressing it to the right (negative pressure) will open the jaws.

- Software-driven testing:

  > To test if the jaws are available after installation, use myBlockly.
  > [myblockly download](../../../5-ProgramingApplication-myblockly-uiflow-mind/5.1-myblockly/5.1.1-myBlocklyFirstUse.md#myblockly下载安装)

  1. After confirming that the structural and electrical connections are complete, start the arm and open the myblockly software when the graphical interface appears.
     ![](../../../resources/1-ProductIntroduction/1.4/1.4.1-Gripper/4-FlexibleGripper/myblockly验证0.png)
  2. Modify the baud rate to 115200:
     ![](../../../resources/1-ProductIntroduction/1.4/1.4.1-Gripper/4-FlexibleGripper/myblockly验证1.png)
