## TCP/IP

TCP/IP, or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is one of the most fundemental communicative protocol on Internet, which stipulates the standard and methods of the Internet communication. Users can control robotic arms remotely through connecting with IP address instead of the USB port.

In this chapter, myCobot 280 M5 is used as an example for explanation.

**Make sure that M5Stack-basic and Atom are both burnt before using.**

### Connection

#### 1.1 WIFI

Follow the steps below.

**Step 1:** Press WLAN Server, and "WIFI Connecting" appears, signaling that the robotic arm is connecting with WIFI.

**Step 2:** If the screen shows WIFI Connected, IP and Port, it means that robotic arm is successfully connected with WIFI.

##### 1.2 Mobile Network

**Step 1:** It is required to change the name of hotspot on your smartphone into the same as that on the robotic arm, namely "MyCobotWiFi2.4G". Meanwhile, change the password of hotspot as "mycobot123".

> **Notice:** If it fails to connect, go back to press USB UART and then try the steps above again.

##### 1.3 Solution to Failed Connection

**Step 1:** Update the version of Atom and M5Stakc-basic to the minirobot v2.0 and atommain v4.1.

**Step 2:** Click on the icon to open the software UartAssist.exe.

**Step 6:** Press `Transponder` on the M5Stack-basic and then press USB UART.

**Step 7:** Set COM configurations, and then click on "Open". After that, click on "Start Send".
