## 3 ROS Environment building

### 3.1 Installing ROS

Building a basic development environment requires the installation of the robot operating system (short for ROS), MoveIt and a git version manager. The installation methods and procedures are described respectively below.

#### 3.1.1 Selecting a version

There is a one-to-one relationship between ROS and ubuntu. Different versions of ubuntu correspond to different versions of ROS. The reference website is as follows: [http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions](http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions)

+ Here are the ROS versions supported by Ubuntu:
  + Ubuntu 16.04 / ROS Kinetic
  + Ubuntu 18.04 / ROS Melodic
  + Ubuntu 20.04 / ROS Noetic

**Install the ROS version corresponding to the Ubuntu version you have installed.**

If the versions are different, the downloading will fail. The system we choose here is Ubuntu 18.04, so the corresponding ROS version is ROS Melodic.

>NOTE: At present, we do not provide any reference for installing ROS in windows. If necessary, refer to [https://www.ros.org/install/](https://www.ros.org/install/)

#### 3.1.2 Start installation

##### 1 Adding a software source

There is no ROS software source in the software source list of Ubuntu itself, so you need to Configure the ROS software source into the software list repository first, and then download ROS. Open a console terminal (shortcut key: Ctrl+Alt+T) and input the following command:

- official source:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

- If the download speed is slow, it is recommended to select a nearby mirror source to replace the above command. For example, Tsinghua University is:
  
```bash
sudo sh -c '. /etc/lsb-release && echo "deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ros/ubuntu/ `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

Here you will be asked to input a user password. Just input the user password set when Ubuntu is installed.

##### 2 Setting a key

**Configuring a public key.** This step is to let the system confirm that our path is safe, so that there is no problem in downloading the file. Otherwise it will be deleted immediately after downloading:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
```

The execution result is displayed as follows:

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/install-ros-2.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

##### 3 Installation

After adding a new software source, you need to update the software source list. Open a console terminal (shortcut key: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>) and input the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Execute **Installing ROS**. Open a console terminal (shortcut key: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>) and input the following command according to your Ubuntu version:

```bash
# Ubuntu 16.04
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
```

It is recommended to install the complete ROS here to prevent the lack of libraries and dependencies.

**The installation process takes a long time, so please wait with patience.**

- If the following error message appears on the console terminal during the installation process, you need to replace the software source list in /etc/apt/sources.list.

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/ros-2.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

- Open a console terminal (shortcut key:<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>),enter the following command:
  
```bash
sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
```

```
```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
```

**The installation process takes a long time, so please wait with patience.**


##### 4 Configuring the ROS environment to the system

rosdep allows you to easily install the source codes you want to compile, or the system dependencies required by some ROS core components. Execute the following commands in sequence in the terminal, and open a console terminal (shortcut key: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>).


If your system does not have rosdep installed, use the command `sudo apt install python-rosdep` to install it.

If the system of the Ubuntu installed by you is version 20.04, use the command `sudo apt install python3-rosdep` to it install. After completion, execute the rosdep initialization command.

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/install-ros-4.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

**initialize rosdep:**

```bash
sudo rosdep init
```

If the following error message appears:

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/ros-3.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

**Solution:** Modify the hosts file and enter the following command in the console terminal:

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/hosts
```

At the end of the file content, add the IP addresses of the following two URLs to access:

```bash
199.232.28.133 raw.githubusercontent.com
151.101.228.133 raw.github.com
```

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/ros-6.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

After the modification is complete, execute in the console terminal:

```bash
sudo rosdep init
```
```bash
rosdep update
```

After the initialization is completed, in order to avoid re-validating the ROS function path every time the terminal window is closed, we can **set the path to an environment variable**, so that each time you open a new terminal, the ROS function path will automatically take effect. Execute the following commands in sequence in the terminal, and open a console terminal (shortcut key: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>):

#### 3.1.3 Set up the ros environment

##### 1 Bash

Execute the following commands:

```bash
# Ubuntu 16.04
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04
echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc  
```

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

##### 2 Install dependencies

Input the following command in the terminal to install a ROS extra dependency, and open a console terminal (shortcut key: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>):

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
```

If your Unbutu system is version 20.04, please execute the following command to install:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential
```

```bash
# Ubuntu 16.04
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-joint-state-publisher-gui 
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04 
sudo apt install ros-melodic-joint-state-publisher-gui 
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04 
sudo apt install ros-noetic-joint-state-publisher-gui   
```

#### 3.1.4 Verify installation

The startup of the ROS system requires a ROS Master, that is, a node manager. We can input the roscore command in the terminal to start the ROS Master.

To verify whether ROS has been installed successfully, open a console terminal (shortcut key: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>) and execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
roscore
```

When the following interface is displayed, it means that ROS has been installed successfully.

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/install-ros-3.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

The roscore command starts a node manager, which is used for node management. In a ros system, there is and only one node manager, which is the prerequisite for the operation of the ros node, so before executing the start of the ros node, roscore needs to be executed in the first step.


_For more detailed installation instructions, you can refer to the official installation instructions by visiting the website:_: [http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
