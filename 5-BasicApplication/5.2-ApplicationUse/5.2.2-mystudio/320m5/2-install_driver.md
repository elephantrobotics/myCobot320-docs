# Install driver

Users can click the button below to download the corresponding **CP210X** or **CP34X** driver compressed package according to the operating system they are using. After decompressing the compressed package, select the installation package corresponding to the number of bits of the operating system to install.

There are currently two driver chip versions, **CP210X** (applicable to CP2104 version) and **CP34X** (applicable to CH9102 version) driver compressed package. If you are not sure which USB chip your device uses, you can install both drivers at the same time. (**CH9102_VCP_SER_MacOS** During the installation process, an error may appear, but the installation has actually been completed, so just ignore it.)

For Mac OS, before installing make sure system "Preferences->Security & Privacy->General" and allow access from App Store and Recognized Developers.

- As shown in the figure below, open **Device Manager** and view **Ports (COM and LPT)**

![frimware_check](../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.2/m5/img/4.1.1.3-firmware_check.gif)

  * If **Port (COM and LPT)** displays **USB-Enhanced-SERIAL CH9102**, it is **CP34X chip**

![CP34X](../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.2/m5/img/4.1.1.3-CP34X.jpg)

  * If **Port (COM and LPT)** shows **Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge**, it is **CP210X chip**
