**myBlockly** is a completely visual modular programming software that is a graphical programming language.

**myBlockly** is similar in function/design to MIT's children's programming language Scratch.

When using **myBlockly**, users can build code logic by dragging modules. The process is like building blocks.

From the user's perspective, **myBlockly** is a simple and easy-to-use visual tool for generating code. From a developer's perspective, **myBlockly** is a text box that contains the code entered by the user.

The process of generating code into the text box is the process of the user dragging it in **myBlockly**.





## The operating systems supported by myBlockly are as follows:

- Windows

- macOS
