## **<font size=5>Program running</font>**

Before officially starting programming, be sure to select the corresponding **machine model**, otherwise it will easily cause hardware damage.

First connect `myCobot 320 M5` to our computer through `USB data cable`,

<img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/connect_pc.jpg" style="zoom: 33%;" />

<img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/connect_ok.gif" style="zoom:80%;" />



And then we select the initialization model as `myCobot 320`, the port connected to my computer is `COM8`, and the baud rate is `115200`

![](../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/2.png)



#### small case

We use building blocks to implement such a small case: let the robotic arm return to the zero point, and then move a joint 30 degrees.



- Make sure robot is power on

  Click the `Status` category in the toolbox, select the `Power On` building block and drag it to the workspace

  ![](../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/power_on1.png)





  ![](../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/power_on2.png)



  Click to `Run` button

  ![](../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/power_on3.png)



If the `End of program` text appears in the popup, the program is finish.

Check whether the device is successfully powered on.

If the joint of the machine cannot be broken by hand, it is successfully powered on



And please click the `X` button to close  pop-up window

##### Let's start with our little case study



- Click the `MDI Control` category in the toolbox, select the `Set Angle` building block and drag it to the workspace

![](../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/小案例1.png)

<img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/小案例2.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Click the `Time` category in the toolbox, select the `Sleep` building block and drag it to the workspace; click the mouse on the input box and change the input value of the building block to `5`

<img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/小案例3.png" style="zoom:67%;" />

<img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/小案例4.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />

- Click the `MDI Control` category in the toolbox again, select the `Set Angle` building block and drag it to the workspace; at the same time, change the input value of `J1` to 30

  <img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/小案例5.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />

- <img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/小案例6.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />





- Click the "Python" option in the upper left corner to view the corresponding Python code, as shown in the figure below.

<img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/小案例代码.png" style="zoom:80%;" />



- Click the `Run` button to run the code and observe the movement of the robotic arm.

<img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/run.png" style="zoom: 80%;" />



- Program is running

  <img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/run1.png" style="zoom: 80%;" />

- The program ends

  <img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/run2.png" style="zoom:80%;" />



- Click the `x` button in the upper right corner of the run pop-up window to close the pop-up window



**Notice**:

- The program to operate the robot arm takes time to complete, so a `sleep' module needs to be connected after one action to give the robot arm time to move before proceeding with the next movement. (You decide the time required based on the situation. By default, the robotic arm is set to run myBlockly for a minimum sleep time of no less than 0.5 seconds.) Otherwise, the robotic arm will not be able to achieve the ideal movement.

- When the program cannot run, please check whether the small toolbar is disconnected (as shown in the figure below).

**<font size=5>Using the control panel</font>**



<img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/open_qm.png" style="zoom:67%;" />







When using the control panel to control the machine, be sure to select the corresponding **machine model**, otherwise it will easily cause hardware damage.

Here we choose the model `myCobot 320` ,`Port` is `COM8`,and the baud rate `115200`

> Note: The port that is actually connected to the computer shall prevail.



<img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/qm.png" style="zoom: 67%;" />



After selecting the model and port, click the `Open` button to connect the robotic arm.

![](../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/open.png)

Read angles and coordinates

- Click the read angle button to read the machine angle value

- Click the Read Coordinates button to read the machine coordinates



You can control the movement of the robot arm joints by clicking the mouse, long pressing the `-/+` button, and modifying the values.





## **<font size=5>Program saving and loading</font>**

MyBlockly's program is saved in *.json format. Click the blue box in the upper right corner of the interface. When the "Save" option appears, click it to save the program.

<img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/save.png" />





Also click the blue box and click the "Load" option to import the saved program.

<img src="../../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.2.1/m5/img/interface/load.png" />
