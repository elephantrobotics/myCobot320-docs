## pico firmware update instructions

| Version | Firmware function description (function items)               | Version iteration record                                     | Firmware usage instructions                                  | Applicable devices       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| V1.0    | Robot control communication speed is within 20ms<br />1. Single/multi-angle/coordinate control; <br />2. Obtain angle/coordinates<br />3. Adaptive/electric gripper, system Pump control... |                                                              | 1. This version of atom needs to be burned with v5.0 <br />2. The servo needs to support synchronous reading and writing<br />3. This version, the basic firmware needs to be burned with miniRobotV2.0 | 1 , 2022 devices--so far |
| V1.2    | Robot control communication speed is within 20ms<br />1. Single/multi-angle/coordinate control;<br /> 2. Obtain angle/coordinates<br />3. Adaptive/electric gripper, system Pump control... | New functions:<br /> 1. Modify the servo pdi: save the last modified value when power off;<br /> 2. Adapt to the new adaptive gripper: add io control compared to before Clamp; <br />Optimization content: <br />1. Control LED lights, terminal IO control, electric clamp control, optimize control reliability, and it will not take effect after several clicks like before. <br />Modification content:<br />1. releaseServo, releaseallservos, the damping mode can be canceled when releasing, and the default is damping mode (there is resistance when the joint is relaxed, making it difficult to drag). | 1. This version of atom needs to be burned with v5.0 <br />2. The servo needs to support synchronous reading and writing<br />3. This version, the basic firmware needs to be burned with miniRobotV2.2 | 1. 2022 device-- So far  |
| V1.3    | Robot control communication speed is within 20ms<br />1. Single/multi-angle/coordinate control;<br /> 2. Obtain angle/coordinates<br />3. Adaptive/electric gripper, system Pump control... | Repair content: <br />1. When turning on the machine, the initial sending point will not return to zero first and will move normally; <br />2. When stopped during motion, the robotic arm will not fall. Optimization content: Motion control optimization. | Applicable to all                                            | 1. 2023 devices--so far  |
