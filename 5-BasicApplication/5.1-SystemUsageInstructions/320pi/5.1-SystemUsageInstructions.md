# System instruction manual

## 5.1.1 Robot system introduction

**System**

- Ubuntu is the most widely used linux operating system for personal desktop operating systems. For beginners, familiarity with the linux environment or some embedded hardware operating system is a good choice. The official ubuntu website has also released a dedicated operating system for the Raspberry PI.

  - Password：**Elephant**

- **How to change password**

  - change account password

    - Use the shortcut key `ctrl + alt + T` to open the terminal
    - Enter `passwd`
    - Enter the new password twice

  - change vnc password

    - Use the shortcut key `ctrl + alt + T` to open the terminal
    - Enter `vncpasswd`
    - Enter the new password twice

  - change ssh password

    - For SSH remote connection, the password of the administrator account is entered. You do not need to change the password separately

  - change root account password

    - Use the shortcut key `ctrl + alt + T` to open the terminal
    - Enter `sudo passwd`
    - Enter the new password twice

    

## 5.1.3 VNC

- **VNC Introduction**

  - Is a remote control software, generally used to remotely solve computer problems or software debugging

- **VNC Port**

  - When the robot arm and PC are connected to the same WiFi, the IP address of the robot arm is the port

- **Connect VNC**

  - There are two wireless connection modes. The first mode requires an external monitor to do some operations on the system. The specific steps are as follows:： Click **“Disconnect”**，disconnect the default hotspot connection

    ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.3-1.png)

    Click **"Enable Wi-Fi"** , and the currently available WiFi will appear

    ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.3-2.png)

    Click on the WiFi you need to connect to, enter the password

    ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.3-3.png)

    After connect successfully，click **"Connection Information"** to check IP address of the robot

    ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.3-4.png)

    As shown in the example，**“192.168.10.64”** is the current IP address of the robot

    ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.3-5.png)

    Connect your PC and the robot to the same WiFi，open the VNC viewer，enter the IP address（examples : input **192.168.10.64**），enter the password **Elephant**，The user name is not specified by default. The following is an example of a successful connection：

    ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.3-6.png)

  - The second method doesn't need to connect the monitor, directly connect the Ubuntu system hotspot with a PC for remote control, but this connection method does not have the function of Internet surfing, and can only remotely control the robot arm system. The specific steps are as follows:

    Connect tp the hotspot **ElephantRobotics_AP_XXXX**，enter the password **Elephant**

    ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.3-7.png)

    Open VNC viewer，input IP address **10.42.0.1** ，enter，and then enter the password **Elephant**，The user name is not specified by default. The following is an example of a successful connection：

    ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.3-8.png)

- **How can I improve connection fluency**
  - The fluency of the remote connection depends on the fluency of the connected WiFi. It is recommended to connect to a stable WiFi for remote control



## 5.1.4 SSH

- **SSH Introduction**

  - SSH is a network protocol used for encrypted logins between computers. If a user logs in from a local computer to another remote computer using SSH, we can assume that this login is secure, even if it is intercepted in the middle, the password will not be disclosed.

- **SSH Port**

  - The default port number is 22

- **SSH Connect**

  - Confirm the IP address of the robot by following instructions in **5.1.2 VNC**

  - Click `win + R` and enter `cmd`![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.4-1.png)

  - After input, click OK to open the shell interface

    ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.4-2.png)

  - Enter `ssh er@IP address` ，then press `Enter` (the IP address is mainly displayed by the robot arm, the figure is only an example)

    ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.4-3.png)

  - Enter password `Elephant`

    ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.4-4.png)

  - As shown in the above figure, the robot arm has been successfully connected by ssh

- **How can I improve connection fluency**

  - The fluency of the remote connection depends on the fluency of the connected WiFi. It is recommended to connect to a stable WiFi for remote controll



## 5.1.5 Network configuration

- **Default AP usage**

  - Power on the robot，by default, the system will connect to the hotspot generated by the PI itself, the hotspot name is**ElephantRobotics_AP_XXXX**，current IP address**10.42.0.1**，this hot spot does not have the function of web surfing, and the transmission rate and information is limited, so there will be some distortion and color difference in the final imaging, and there will be a delay in communication transmission, which is a normal phenomenon

- **Connect to WLAN**

  Click **"Disconnect"** to turn off default hotspot

  ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.5-1.png)

  Click **"Enable Wi-Fi"** ， wait for the currently available WiFi to be displayed

  ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.5-2.png)

  Click the WiFi you want to connect to and enter the WiFi password

  ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.5-3.png)

  After connect successfully，click **"Connection Information"** to check IP address

  ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.5-4.png)

  As shown in the example，**“192.168.10.64”**, It is the current IP address of the robot

  ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.5-5.png)

  **Wired network connection**

  Power on the robot, it is connected to the hotspot configured by the system by default: 

  **ElephantRobotics_AP_XXXX**

  ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.5-6.png)

  Click **“Disconnect”**，disconnect from the default hotspot

  ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.5-7.png)

  Connect the network cable to the network port of the robot

  ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.5-8.png)

  Connect the Internet cable to the network port of the robot

  ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.5-9.png)

  **How to set default IP address**

  Use shortcut keys `ctrl + alt + T` to open the terminal，enter`sudo vim /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml`，modify 01-network-manager-all.yaml file as follows:

  ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.5-10.png)

  After modification，enter`sudo netplan apply`to make the configuration take effect

  **How to assign IP addresses automatically**

  When the system is connected to WiFi, the IP address is automatically assigned, If you want to change the fixed IP address to automatically assign an IP address, modify /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml file as follows:

  ![](../../../resources/5-BasicApplication/5.1/5.1.5-11.png)

  After modification，enter`sudo netplan apply`to make the configuration take effect



## 5.1.6 BT configuration
