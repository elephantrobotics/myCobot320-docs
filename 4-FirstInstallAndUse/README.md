### 2 Installation Requirements

myCobot weights 3.3 kg. Due to the fact that the center of gravity will change along with the movement of the robot during utilization, robot is required to be fixed on a solid base at the beginning. A fixed base, or mobile base are both acceptable.

#### Base Interface Size

* The base fixing holes act as the interface between robot and other bases or planes. The specific hole size is shown in the figure below. There are 4 countersunk holes with a diameter of 4.5 mm, which can be fixed with M6 bolts.

- The end is mounted with flange and is compatible with both LEGO component holes and screw threaded holes. Please make sure that there are corresponding threaded holes on the fixed base before installing.


#### *Before the installation, please confirm:*

- The environment to be installed meets the requirements of Section 2.2.2.3.1 above.

- The installation position is not smaller than the working range of the robot, and there is enough space for installation, use, maintenance and repair.

- Put the stand in a suitable position.

- Installation related tools are ready, such as screws, wrenches, etc.

- After confirming the above, please move the robot to the base mounting table, adjust the robot position, and align the fixing holes of the robot base with the holes on the base mounting table. After aligning the holes, align the screws with the holes and tighten them.

  Note: When adjusting the position of the robot on the base installation table, please try to avoid pushing and pulling the robot directly on the base installation table to avoid scratches. When manually moving the robot, try to avoid applying external force to the fragile parts of the robot body, so as to avoid unnecessary damage to the robot.

### 3 Power on the Robot

Before operation, confirm that you have read **Chapter 1 Safety Instructions** to ensure safe operation. At the same time, connect the power adapter with the robotic arm, and fix the base of the robotic arm on the table. The connection method is shown in Figure 3-1.

​																	Figure 3-1 Location of the power connector

myCobot must be powered on with an external power supply to provide sufficient power:

- Rated voltage: 24V
- Rated current: 9.4A
- Plug Type: KPPX-4P R7BFDC

Note that when using, please connect the 320 adapter first, and then connect to the typeC. You cannot just use the TypeC plugged into the M5Stack-basic for power supply. Please use the official power supply to avoid damage to the robotic arm.

### **4 Driver Installation**

The Raspberry Pi version of the robotic arm has a built-in software driver package, which can be used after booting without tedious installation steps.

### 5 Connecting to PC via USB

The Raspberry Pi version of the robotic arm has a built-in UBUNTU system, so there is no need to connect to other computers.
